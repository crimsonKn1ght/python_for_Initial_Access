# python_for_Initial_Access
Using python to gain initial access

**autorun.py** is a python script designed at running scripts automatically after being injected into a system by a vector like *USBs*, etc. And if autorun is disabled on the victim end, a bit of social engineering can help to convince the user into running the malicious executable. If we set the icon of the file and name to that of a *legitimate executable* or program we can convince the user into manually running it.

**defAccDisc.py** is a python script for brute forcing both *SSH* and *Telnet*for gaining user credentials.
